# CouchDB Worker Implementation Plan

This document outlines the phased approach to implementing CouchDB functionality on Cloudflare Workers.

## Phase 1: Proxy Implementation (Current)

- ✅ Basic Worker setup with wrangler.toml
- ✅ Proxy implementation that forwards requests to a CouchDB instance
- ✅ Basic documentation and deployment scripts

## Phase 2: Basic Document Operations

- [ ] Implement document storage using R2
  - [ ] Create a document schema
  - [ ] Implement PUT/POST for document creation
  - [ ] Implement GET for document retrieval
  - [ ] Implement DELETE for document deletion
  - [ ] Implement document versioning (_rev)
- [ ] Implement database operations
  - [ ] Create database
  - [ ] Delete database
  - [ ] List databases
- [ ] Add basic validation and error handling

## Phase 3: Advanced Document Features

- [ ] Implement attachments
  - [ ] Store attachments in R2
  - [ ] Handle attachment metadata
- [ ] Implement bulk operations
  - [ ] Bulk document creation/update
  - [ ] Bulk document retrieval
- [ ] Implement document conflicts handling
- [ ] Add support for document revisions and history

## Phase 4: Views and Queries

- [ ] Implement MapReduce views
  - [ ] Execute map functions in the Worker
  - [ ] Execute reduce functions in the Worker
  - [ ] Store view results in KV or R2
- [ ] Implement Mango queries (JSON-based query language)
  - [ ] Basic selectors
  - [ ] Indexing for queries
- [ ] Implement changes feed
  - [ ] Long-polling changes feed
  - [ ] WebSocket changes feed (if supported)

## Phase 5: Authentication and Security

- [ ] Implement user authentication
  - [ ] Basic authentication
  - [ ] Cookie authentication
  - [ ] JWT authentication
- [ ] Implement user management
  - [ ] Create/update/delete users
  - [ ] User roles and permissions
- [ ] Implement document-level security
  - [ ] Validate user permissions for operations

## Phase 6: Replication

- [ ] Implement replication protocol
  - [ ] Pull replication from CouchDB to Worker
  - [ ] Push replication from Worker to CouchDB
  - [ ] Worker-to-Worker replication
- [ ] Handle replication conflicts
- [ ] Implement filtered replication

## Phase 7: Performance Optimization

- [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed documents
- [ ] Optimize storage patterns for R2 and KV
- [ ] Implement batch processing for better performance
- [ ] Add compression for document storage and transfer

## Phase 8: Client Libraries and Tools

- [ ] Create/adapt client libraries for the Worker
- [ ] Create administration tools
- [ ] Add monitoring and logging

## Technical Considerations

### Storage Strategy

- **Documents**: Store in R2 with metadata in KV
- **Attachments**: Store in R2 with pointers in document metadata
- **Indexes**: Store in KV or Durable Objects
- **User data**: Store in KV

### Durable Objects Usage

- Coordination for concurrent operations
- Maintaining consistent state for operations that require it
- Managing distributed locks if needed

### Limitations to Address

- R2 eventual consistency vs. CouchDB's consistency model
- Worker execution time limits
- Memory limits in the Worker environment
