# Active Context

## What we're working on now
Setting up CouchDB to run on Cloudflare Workers. We've created a basic Cloudflare Worker that implements CouchDB-like functionality directly in the Worker, using in-memory storage for demonstration purposes.

## Recent changes
- Cloned the CouchDB GitHub repository
- Attempted to deploy to Cloudflare Workers using Wrangler
- Encountered error: "Missing entry-point: The entry-point should be specified via the command line (e.g. `wrangler deploy path/to/script`) or the `main` config field."
- Created configuration files in the root directory to address the deployment error:
  - wrangler.toml: Configuration for the Cloudflare Worker
  - src/index.js: Entry point for the Worker
  - package.json: Node.js package configuration
  - .gitignore: Git ignore file
  - README.md: Documentation for the Worker
  - deploy.sh: Deployment script
- Fixed "Direct IP access not allowed" error by:
  - Removing the circular reference in the COUCHDB_URL configuration
  - Implementing basic CouchDB-like functionality directly in the Worker
  - Adding proper CORS headers and error handling

## Next steps
1. Test the Worker functionality at https://couchdb.brisflix.workers.dev
2. Enhance the Worker to implement more CouchDB functionality:
   - Use Cloudflare's KV, Durable Objects, or R2 for persistent storage
   - Implement proper document revision handling
   - Add support for views and queries
   - Implement authentication and authorization
   - Add support for attachments
   - Implement replication protocol
3. Test the Worker with CouchDB clients
