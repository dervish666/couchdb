# Active Context

## What we're working on now
Setting up CouchDB to run on Cloudflare Workers. We've created a basic Cloudflare Worker that acts as a proxy to a CouchDB instance, with files in both the root directory and a worker subdirectory.

## Recent changes
- Cloned the CouchDB GitHub repository
- Attempted to deploy to Cloudflare Workers using Wrangler
- Encountered error: "Missing entry-point: The entry-point should be specified via the command line (e.g. `wrangler deploy path/to/script`) or the `main` config field."
- Created a worker directory with documentation and helper scripts
- Created configuration files in the root directory to address the deployment error:
  - wrangler.toml: Configuration for the Cloudflare Worker
  - src/index.js: Entry point for the Worker that proxies requests to a CouchDB instance
  - package.json: Node.js package configuration
  - .gitignore: Git ignore file
  - README.md: Documentation for the Worker

## Next steps
1. Test the deployment with the root-level configuration files
2. If successful, enhance the Worker to implement more CouchDB functionality natively:
   - Implement document CRUD operations using Cloudflare storage
   - Add support for views and queries
   - Implement authentication and authorization
   - Add replication support
3. Test the Worker with CouchDB clients
