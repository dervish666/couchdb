# System Patterns

## How the system is built
The system aims to adapt CouchDB to run on Cloudflare Workers. This represents a significant architectural shift from CouchDB's traditional Erlang-based server model to a JavaScript/TypeScript serverless implementation.

## Key technical decisions
1. **Runtime Environment**: Transition from Erlang VM to JavaScript V8 isolates on Cloudflare Workers
2. **Storage Layer**: Replace CouchDB's file-based storage with Cloudflare's storage options:
   - KV for small metadata and configuration
   - Durable Objects for state management and coordination
   - R2 for document storage (similar to S3)
3. **API Compatibility**: Maintain CouchDB's HTTP API interface for client compatibility
4. **Replication**: Adapt CouchDB's replication protocol to work within serverless constraints
5. **Authentication**: Leverage Cloudflare Workers' authentication mechanisms while maintaining CouchDB's auth model

## Architecture patterns
1. **Serverless Architecture**: Stateless request handling with external state management
2. **Edge Computing**: Distributed processing across Cloudflare's global network
3. **API Gateway**: The Worker acts as an API gateway to underlying storage services
4. **Event-Driven**: Operations trigger events that can be processed asynchronously
5. **Microservices**: Potentially split functionality across multiple specialized Workers
