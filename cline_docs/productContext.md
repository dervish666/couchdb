# Product Context

## Why this project exists
This project aims to run CouchDB on Cloudflare Workers, a serverless platform. The goal is to leverage the distributed nature of Cloudflare's edge network to provide a globally available, low-latency database service based on CouchDB.

## What problems it solves
- Eliminates the need for managing dedicated CouchDB server infrastructure
- Provides global distribution through Cloudflare's edge network
- Potentially reduces latency for database operations by running closer to users
- Enables serverless database capabilities with CouchDB's document-oriented model

## How it should work
The project should adapt CouchDB (traditionally an Erlang-based server application) to run within Cloudflare Workers' JavaScript/V8 runtime environment. This likely involves:

1. Creating a JavaScript/TypeScript interface that implements CouchDB's core functionality
2. Configuring proper entry points for the Cloudflare Worker
3. Managing data persistence through Cloudflare's storage options (KV, Durable Objects, or R2)
4. Implementing CouchDB's HTTP API to maintain compatibility with existing clients
5. Adapting CouchDB's replication protocol to work within the constraints of Cloudflare Workers
